Starbucks Happy Hour is a project made alongside my course in [B7Web](https://b7web.com.br/fullstack/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-7eYj5vT-QIVEz6RCh2VfgXQEAAYASAAEgJfifD_BwE&ref=I24108426I) in order to practice HTML and CSS (with a particular focus on flexbox and grid layout). It's a one page website designed and coded considering mobile first.
